    <p class="legal-intro">
      These Terms and Conditions (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your use of Johny Sins (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;), an application that connects your Google workspace (Gmail, Chat, Drive, Tasks) with <a href="https://oshaani.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oshaani.com</a> AI agents for workflows such as email summarization, reply drafting, and Chat auto-reply. By signing in with Google or otherwise using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and have the authority to bind yourself or your organization.

        <li>Workflows (e.g. Smart Inbox, First email draft, Document intelligence, Chat auto-reply) that process your data and may send context to Oshaani AI agents to generate summaries, drafts, or replies.</li>

    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any law.</li>
        <li>Use the Service to send spam, harass others, or distribute malware.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other users&rsquo; data, or any system or network.</li>
        <li>Abuse or overload the Service (e.g. excessive API or workflow requests) or use it in a way that harms Oshaani, Google, or third parties.</li>
        <li>Resell or sublicense the Service without our written permission, or use it to build a competing product that merely replicates the Service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>4. Your data and permissions</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for the data you provide and for ensuring you have the right to use it (e.g. you have permission to process emails and messages in the way the workflows do). By enabling workflows, you authorize us to read and write data in your connected Google account and to send relevant context to Oshaani as needed to perform the workflows. Our handling of personal data is described in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p><strong>The Service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available.&rdquo;</strong> We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. AI-generated content (summaries, drafts, replies) may be inaccurate or inappropriate; you are responsible for reviewing and approving any content before it is sent or published. We are not liable for decisions you make based on AI output or for any loss of data, revenue, or goodwill arising from your use of the Service.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>6. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we (and our affiliates, suppliers, and licensors) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, data, or use, arising out of or in connection with the Service or these Terms. Our total liability for any claims arising from the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim (or one hundred dollars (100 USD) if you have not paid us). Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>8. Termination</h2>
      <p>You may stop using the Service at any time by signing out and revoking access in your Google account. We may suspend or terminate your access or the Service with or without notice if we believe you have breached these Terms or for operational or legal reasons. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases; provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g. disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification) will survive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will update the &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date and, for material changes, we will provide notice (e.g. via the Service or email if we have it). Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>10. General</h2>
      <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right does not waive that right. These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which we operate, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. For questions, contact us via <a href="https://oshaani.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oshaani.com</a> or the support channel provided where you access Johny Sins.</p>
