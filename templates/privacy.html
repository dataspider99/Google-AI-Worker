    <p class="legal-intro">
      Johny Sins (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the service&rdquo;) is an application that connects your Google account (Gmail, Chat, Drive, Tasks) with <a href="https://oshaani.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oshaani.com</a> AI agents to run workflows such as inbox summarization, reply drafting, and Chat auto-reply. This policy describes what data we collect, how we use and store it, and your choices.
    </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>1. Data we collect and use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google account data</strong> – When you sign in with Google (OAuth), we receive and store access and refresh tokens so we can, on your behalf, read and write data in Gmail, Google Chat, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Tasks. We do not see or store your Google password.</li>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> – We use your Google account email to identify your session and to associate your credentials and settings with your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Content processed by workflows</strong> – To run workflows (e.g. Smart Inbox, Document intelligence, Chat auto-reply), we read relevant content (emails, Chat messages, Drive files) via Google APIs and may send summaries or excerpts to Oshaani&rsquo;s AI agents to generate replies, summaries, or action items. This processing is done in accordance with the workflows you enable.</li>
        <li><strong>Oshaani API key</strong> – If you provide your own Oshaani agent API key, it is stored in your Google Drive (folder &ldquo;Johny Sins&rdquo;) and used only for your workflow runs.</li>
        <li><strong>API keys</strong> – If you generate an API key for scripts or MCP, we store a hash of the key to authenticate requests; we cannot recover the original key.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>2. Where your data is stored</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Google Drive</strong> – User credentials and optional Oshaani key are stored in a folder named &ldquo;Johny Sins&rdquo; in your Google Drive. You can view or delete this folder at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Server</strong> – A minimal bootstrap (e.g. refresh token reference) may be stored on our servers so we can refresh your Google access after restarts. No email or message content is stored long-term on our servers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>3. Third-party services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google</strong> – We use Google OAuth and Google APIs. Your use of the service is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&rsquo;s Privacy Policy</a> and their API terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Oshaani</strong> – Workflow content (e.g. summaries, message excerpts) may be sent to Oshaani.com for AI processing. Oshaani has its own privacy and data practices; we encourage you to review their policy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>4. How we use your data</h2>
      <p>We use your data only to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the Johny Sins workflows you enable.</li>
        <li>Run scheduled automation (e.g. Run all) when you have turned automation on.</li>
        <li>Authenticate you (sessions and API keys) and store your preferences (workflow toggles, Oshaani key).</li>
        <li>Improve reliability (e.g. logging of errors); we do not sell your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>5. Your choices and rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can <strong>sign out</strong> and revoke access at any time. You can also remove the app&rsquo;s access in your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google account permissions</a>.</li>
        <li>You can <strong>disable automation</strong> or individual workflows from the dashboard.</li>
        <li>You can <strong>delete the &ldquo;Johny Sins&rdquo; folder</strong> from your Google Drive to remove stored credentials and Oshaani key from our use.</li>
        <li>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data; contact us (see below) to request this.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard practices to protect credentials and data in transit and at rest. Sessions use secure cookies in production (HTTPS). API keys are stored as hashes. We do not log message or email content beyond what is necessary for error diagnosis.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>7. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date at the top will be revised when we make material changes. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    </section>
